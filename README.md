The Bee is a puzzle consisting of seven letters, with one central "special" letter,
arranged like so:

     e   g
   n   P   r
     s   t

The center letter has to be used in all answers. Letters can be used any number
of times to make up words of four letters or more. Every puzzles has at least
one pangram, a word that uses all letters. It's possible for a puzzle to have
multiple pangrams. This program finds out how many puzzles are possible and the
